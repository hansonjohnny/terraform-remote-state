# ==============================================================
# This provides a local AWS environment for practicing without costs.
# For real AWS experience, skip LocalStack and use actual AWS credentials.
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose up -d      # Start LocalStack
#   docker-compose down       # Stop LocalStack
#   docker-compose logs -f    # View logs

# NOTE: If port 4566 is in use, change the ports below.
